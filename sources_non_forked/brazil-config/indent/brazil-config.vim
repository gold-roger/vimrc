    " This is similar to C; use the built-in C indenting.
    " Note that Vim takes lines starting with # as preprocessor lines,
    " which causes various issues.
    " For example:
    "       # Some comment (with opening parentheses
    "       # closed only at the next line) (or not at all
    return cindent(v:lnum)
